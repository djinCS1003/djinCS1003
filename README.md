- 👋 Hi, I’m @djinCS1003
- 👀 I’m interested in how to create good questions and solutions using Python for scientific computing from CS1003.
- 👀 I’m also interested in learning more abour statistical (machine) learning at some point.
- 👀 For first-year CS, my goal is to get A+, understanding pretty much everything and being able to solve problems. 
- For 2nd year CS (data sci.), my goal is A, surveying ways to improve the standard programming process and also learning essential skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the standard procedures of data analytics in R and Python, while getting comfortable enough with OOP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on taking good programming notes. Writing on slides is good but not enough space. Latex is not worth the time for this, but Cloud services can be annoying despite the convenience.
